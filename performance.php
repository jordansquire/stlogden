<p>Voice: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form, and void; 
  and the darkness was upon the face of the deep... and God said, &quot;Let there be light.&quot;</p>

<p>On the floor the first light illuminates a giant 8&#39; balloon representing the sun.</p>

<p>Voice: And there was light.</p>

<p>Other balloons representing the planets of the solar system begin to circle the sun. LED lights represent 
  the stars.</p>

<p>Voice: This is the light of Christ. As also he is in the sun, and thereof by which it was Made. the light 
  of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made.</p>

<p>A youth walks to the sun with a lantern in hand. As he reaches the sun' the lantern is lit.</p>

<p>Youth testimonies about the Father creating the universe for us.</p>

<p>Youth testimony about the beautiful earth God created for us.</p>

<p>A giant map of the Ogden Temple District is laid out on the floor by youth. As each piece is laid down, 
  the youth of that area yell where they are from.</p>

<p>Next, comes a scene about the Indians, trappers and traders who were the first in this area.</p>

<p>This paved the way for the early Saints into this area.</p>

<p>A huge pioneer song and dance follows showing this migration.</p>

<p>his is followed by the joining of the rails. We see this historic sceen acted out on the floor with the 
  actual photograph of the event on the screens. A fantastic version of, &quot;I&#39;ve Been Working on the 
  Railroad&quot;, is performed by the entire cast.</p>

<p>Other sections of the production include:
  <ul>     
    <li>Ogden becoming the hub of the railraod</li>
    <li>The choir singing and a brand new original song called &quot;We Are Chosen&quot;.</li>
    <li>Families are featured next with &quot;Love at Home&quot;.</li>
    <li>Baptism is featured in the original new song, &quot;I Am Ready&quot;.</li>
    <li>The next section starts to focus on the Ogden Temple and missionary work.</li> 
    <li>On the floor, 800 youth representing the Army of Helaman, sing &quot;We'll Bring the World His Truth&quot;, 
      which turns into, &quot;Called to Serve&quot; with hundreds of missionaries marching down the aisles with flags 
      from the countries they represent.</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>Narrator: From early pioneers to immigrant families, communitites emerged that embraced the gospel and 
  strove to share it's blessings with others. In a district that stretches from Layton, Utah in the south, to 
  Riverton, Wyoming in the Northeast, members of the Church created such a demant for the blessings of the 
  temple that in 1972, a temple was built in the heart of Ogden. Originally constructed with a modern design, 
  the Ogden temple was unlike any that had come before it. Featuring a large base and a single soire, it was 
  designed to reflect the way the children of Israel were led in the wilderness, with a cloud for shadow by 
  day and a pillar of fire by night.</p>

<p>The full cast begins to sing &quot;Light of a New Day&quot;. Youth fill the floor holding cards. As the lantern 
  passes, the 1972 Ogden Temple appears as they hold their cards together.</p>

<p>As the last chorus of the song begins, the choir and full cast sign the words as the cards flip over to 
  become the new Temple design. The lights become even brighter</p>

<p>End</p>
