  <span class="text_solo">I may be young, but I know where I stand. I may be small but I still understand that<br/>
  I have a purpose my life has a plan. So say I can&#39;t do it, but I know that I can<br/>
  In this world that seems dark and dim with so many friends unable to see<br/>
  I have a light that burns brightly within and I know I can&#39;t just keep it inside of me!</span>
